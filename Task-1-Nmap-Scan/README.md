# Task 1 - Basic Network Scanning  Using Nmap
## Objective
To perform a basic network scan using Nmap on a local machine to identify open ports and running services.

## Tool Used
- Kali Linux
- Nmap

## Scan Command Used
nmap 127.0.0.1
## Scan Results
The scan was performed on the local system. The host was up and all the scanned ports were found to be closed.

## Security Analysis
Since no open ports were detected, the system has minimal exposure to external attacks, which improves its security posture.

## Conclusion
This task demonstrates the use of Nmap for basic network scanning and understanding system exposure.
